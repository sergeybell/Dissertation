	abstract = {The dynamic of longitudinal motion in Barrier Bucket RF structure is considered. To preserve the stability of the proton beam during the acceleration to the experiment energy it is necessary to cross the transition energy and a rapid jump of transition energy is possible. The influence of the second-order slip factor is taking into account. The dynamic aperture is investigated for various gradients of focusing quadrupoles and corresponding working points which is necessary for transition crossing.},

@article{Senichev:2024_nica_edm,
	abstract = {To search for proton Electric Dipole Moments (EDM) using proton storage ring with purely electrostatic elements, the concept of frozen spin method has been proposed by Brookhaven National Laboratory. This method is based on two facts: in the equation of spin precession, the magnetic field dependence is entirely eliminated, and at the ``magic''energy, the spin precession frequency coincides with the precession frequency of the particle momentum. In case of deuteron, we have to use the electrical and magnetic field simultaneously, keeping the frozen spin direction along the momentum as in the pure electrostatic ring. Later, Yu. Senichev proposed the concept of quasi-frozen spin, in which the spin oscillates around the direction of the pulse within half the value of the advanced phase of rotation in magnetic arcs, each time returning back in deflectors with an electrostatic field. Due to the low value of the anomalous magnetic moment of deuteron, an effective contribution to the expected EDM effect is reduced only by a few percent compared with frozen spin method. In this work, we consider the adapted structure of the NICA and Nuclotron synchrotrons, in which the ``quasi-frozen spin''option can be implemented. The advantage of the ``quasi-frozen spin''concept is the possibility of using synchrotrons already existing in the world that are not focused on studying EDM, which makes this method the only one possible for the accelerators of the NICA complex.},

  abstract      = {Two schemes of the polarized proton beam formation are considered for the NICA accelerator complex. In the first scheme, the polarized proton beams are injected from the LILAC linear accelerator into the Nuclotron, where they are accelerated up to a kinetic energy of 1.5--2 GeV and then extracted to the Collider. The injected proton beams are accumulated in the Collider using the RF barriers and electron cooling. After accumulation, the protons are accelerated by the RF1 induction voltage up to the critical relativistic factor γtr = 7.089, where a jump of the betatron frequency occurs. After transition through the critical energy, the protons are accelerated up to the energy of the experiment. For this scheme, a specialized optical lattice is considered. The critical proton energy (γtr = 18.6) for this lattice is larger than the maximal energy of the experiment (12.6 GeV). The so-called spin transparency mode is planned to be used for formation of polarized beams in the Collider. In the second scheme, the polarized proton beams are injected into the Booster from LILAC. The protons are cooled in the Booster, accelerated, and extracted to the Nuclotron. During their acceleration in the Nuclotron, the protons cross the integer spin and spin-betatron resonances. After accelerating protons to the kinetic energy of the experiments of 6--10.86 GeV, the vertically polarized proton beams are transferred to the Collider. At the integer spin resonances following each other with the energy interval of 0.523 GeV, the partial Siberian snake permits the longitudinal polarization to be formed for beams used in the SPD and MPD detectors.},

  abstract = {Transition energy crossing at the U-70 proton synchrotron is studied. Motion stability is achieved through the method of transition energy jump at constant betatron tunes. The longitudinal motion is simulated with allowance for higher orders of the momentum compaction factor, along with various impedances and bunch intensities. Experimental data from an accelerator session are presented.},

  abstract = {The present study explores the application transition energy jump procedure in order to maintain the stability of the beam in the NICA collider. The features of the barrier and harmonic accelerating RF stations and their influence on the dynamics of longitudinal particle motion are described. Study of these features is intended to expand the understanding of the process of transition energy crossing.},
