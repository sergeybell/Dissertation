@article{resonant,
	abstract = {In synchrotrons the transition energy Wtr=m0c2(γtr−1) is fundamentally important because it determines the maximum attainable accelerated currents. From this point of view it is desirable that the momentum compaction factor α= 1/γtr2as small as possible or even negative, which makes γtr imaginary and accordingly rules out transition energy crossing by particles under acceleration. In this connection a theory of ``resonant''lattices with negative momentum compaction factor based on the correlation principle of simultaneous superperiodic modulation of the orbit curvature and lens gradient functions is worked out.},

@inproceedings{bb,
	abstract = {{This paper reports on the design features and construction progress of the three RF systems for the NICA collider being built at JINR, Dubna. Each of the two collider rings has three RF systems named RF1 to 3. RF1 is a barrier bucket system used for particles capturing and accumulation during injection, RF2 and 3 are resonant systems operating at 22nd and 66th harmonics of the revolution frequency and used for the 22 bunches formation. The RF systems are designed and produced by Budker INP. Solid state RF power amplifiers developed by the Triada-TV company, Novosibirsk, are used for driving the RF2 and three cavities. Two RF1 stations were already delivered to JINR, the prototypes of the RF2 and 3 stations were built and successfully tested at BINP. Series production of all eight RF2 and sixteen RF3 stations is in progress. The design modifications and test results are presented.}},
