@article{meshkov:luminocity,
	abstract = {A formula is obtained for the luminosity of a collider at the collision of two beams that differ, generally speaking, by their parameters (asymmetric colliders). The formula is valid for counterpropagating and merging beams with coincident longitudinal axes. Three special cases of the formula are considered: collision of two identical axially symmetric bunched beams, collision of a bunch with a coasting beam, and collision of two coasting beams. Collision of intersecting beams is briefly considered, and the method for the luminosity calculation is formulated. The synchronization problem is considered for collisions of asymmetric beams. A method is presented for optimizing parameters of a cyclic collider by minimizing betatron frequency shifts caused by the effect of the space charge of the beams. Numerical examples of luminosity calculations for several types of asymmetric colliders are given.},

@article{MPD,
	abstract = {The MultiPurpose Detector (MPD) is designed to study heavy-ion collisions at the Nuclotron-based heavy Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) at JINR, Dubna. Its main components located inside a superconducting solenoid are a tracking system composed of a silicon microstrip vertex detector followed by a large volume time-projection chamber, a time-of-flight system for particle identification and a barrel electromagnetic calorimeter. A zero degree hadron calorimeter is designed specifically to measure the energy of spectators. In this paper, all parts of the apparatus are described and their tracking and particle identification (PID) parameters are discussed in some detail.},

In particular, they must have dispersion-free straight sections intended for accommodation of RF cavities, Siberian snakes and detectors, and a large enough dynamic aperture for minimizing the effect of magnetic optics nonlinearity on the beam parameters after chromaticity correction by sextupoles.},

@article{senichev:resonant,
	abstract = {In synchrotrons the transition energy Wtr=m0c2(γtr−1) is fundamentally important because it determines the maximum attainable accelerated currents. From this point of view it is desirable that the momentum compaction factor α= 1/γtr2as small as possible or even negative, which makes γtr imaginary and accordingly rules out transition energy crossing by particles under acceleration. In this connection a theory of ``resonant''lattices with negative momentum compaction factor based on the correlation principle of simultaneous superperiodic modulation of the orbit curvature and lens gradient functions is worked out.},

  abstract     = {A predominantly electric E&amp;m storage ring, with weak superimposed magnetic bending, is shown to be capable of storing two different particle type bunches, such as helion (h) and deuteron (d), or h and electron (e -), co-traveling with different velocities on the same central orbit. Rear-end collisions occurring periodically in a full acceptance particle detector/polarimeter, allow the (previously inaccessible) direct measurement of the spin dependence of nuclear transmutation for center of mass (CM) kinetic energies (KE) ranging from hundreds of keV up toward pion production thresholds.  With the nuclear process occurring in a semi-relativistic moving frame, all initial and final state particles have convenient laboratory frame KEs in the tens to hundreds of MeV.  The rear-end collisions occur as faster stored bunches pass through slower bunches. An inexpensive facility capable of meeting these requirements is described, with several nuclear channels as examples.  Especially noteworthy are the e+/--induced weak interaction triton (t) β-decay processes, t + e + → h + ν and h + e - → t + ν.  Experimental capability of measurement of the spin dependence of the induced triton case is emphasized.  For cosmological nuclear physics, the experimental improvement will be produced by the storage ring's capability to investigate the spin dependence of nuclear transmutation processes at reduced kinetic energies compared to what can be obtained with fixed target geometry.},

It is confirmed that the Standard Model correctly describes the dominant parts of the observed CP-violating and flavor-changing phenomena. Not only does CP violation provide some of the most precise constraints on the flavor sector, but several measurements performed at the B-factories achieved much better precision than expected. We review the present status of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix and CP violation, recollect the relevant experimental and theoretical inputs, display the results from the global CKM fit, and discuss their implications for the Standard Model and some of its extensions.},
