@article{meshkov:luminocity,
	abstract = {A formula is obtained for the luminosity of a collider at the collision of two beams that differ, generally speaking, by their parameters (asymmetric colliders). The formula is valid for counterpropagating and merging beams with coincident longitudinal axes. Three special cases of the formula are considered: collision of two identical axially symmetric bunched beams, collision of a bunch with a coasting beam, and collision of two coasting beams. Collision of intersecting beams is briefly considered, and the method for the luminosity calculation is formulated. The synchronization problem is considered for collisions of asymmetric beams. A method is presented for optimizing parameters of a cyclic collider by minimizing betatron frequency shifts caused by the effect of the space charge of the beams. Numerical examples of luminosity calculations for several types of asymmetric colliders are given.},

@article{MPD,
	abstract = {The MultiPurpose Detector (MPD) is designed to study heavy-ion collisions at the Nuclotron-based heavy Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) at JINR, Dubna. Its main components located inside a superconducting solenoid are a tracking system composed of a silicon microstrip vertex detector followed by a large volume time-projection chamber, a time-of-flight system for particle identification and a barrel electromagnetic calorimeter. A zero degree hadron calorimeter is designed specifically to measure the energy of spectators. In this paper, all parts of the apparatus are described and their tracking and particle identification (PID) parameters are discussed in some detail.},

Apart from allowing elimination of transition energy crossing by accelerated particles, these lattices should meet a number of important requirements. In particular, they must have dispersion-free straight sections intended for accommodation of RF cavities, Siberian snakes and detectors, and a large enough dynamic aperture for minimizing the effect of magnetic optics nonlinearity on the beam parameters after chromaticity correction by sextupoles.},

@article{senichev:resonant,
	abstract = {In synchrotrons the transition energy Wtr=m0c2(γtr−1) is fundamentally important because it determines the maximum attainable accelerated currents. From this point of view it is desirable that the momentum compaction factor α= 1/γtr2as small as possible or even negative, which makes γtr imaginary and accordingly rules out transition energy crossing by particles under acceleration. In this connection a theory of ``resonant''lattices with negative momentum compaction factor based on the correlation principle of simultaneous superperiodic modulation of the orbit curvature and lens gradient functions is worked out.},
