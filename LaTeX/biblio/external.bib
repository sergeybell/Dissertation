Apart from allowing elimination of transition energy crossing by accelerated particles, these lattices should meet a number of important requirements. In particular, they must have dispersion-free straight sections intended for accommodation of RF cavities, Siberian snakes and detectors, and a large enough dynamic aperture for minimizing the effect of magnetic optics nonlinearity on the beam parameters after chromaticity correction by sextupoles.},

@article{senichev:resonant,
	abstract = {In synchrotrons the transition energy Wtr=m0c2(γtr−1) is fundamentally important because it determines the maximum attainable accelerated currents. From this point of view it is desirable that the momentum compaction factor α= 1/γtr2as small as possible or even negative, which makes γtr imaginary and accordingly rules out transition energy crossing by particles under acceleration. In this connection a theory of ``resonant''lattices with negative momentum compaction factor based on the correlation principle of simultaneous superperiodic modulation of the orbit curvature and lens gradient functions is worked out.},
